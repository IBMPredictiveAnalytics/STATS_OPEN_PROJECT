<h1>Open a Project</h1>
<p>This command reads a project file, executes the syntax specified in it,
and opens data (.sav), syntax (.sps), and output (.spv) files listed there.
It can also process other project files, which will be processed in the order listed.
A project file is a plain text file divided into sections.  The format is as follows.
</p>
<p>
[RUN]<br/>
syntax commands in interactive format.  This is equivalent to 
running commands by using the INSERT command.<br/>
[OPEN]<br/>
list of data (.sav), syntax (.sps), and output (.spv) files to open<br/>
[PROJECT]<br/>
list of other project files to be opened<br/>
</p>
<p>
Sections may appear in any order and may be repeated.
Files listed in a PROJECT section are files in this same format.
If you have a standard utility library and various working projects,
it may be convenient to reference a standard project file first from the
working project and then
list additional working project specifications.</p>
<p>
File handles defined in executed RUN sections or before this command can
be used in any section.</p>
<p>
Lines starting with a semicolon are comments and are echoed to the Viewer.</p>
<p>The project file is expected to be in the Unicode UTF-8 encoding.  You can
create such files using the Statistics Syntax Editor or an encoding-aware
editor such as Notepad on Windows.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Project File</span> 
Select a project file that conforms to the format described above.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 
SAV files listed in the OPEN section will be assigned random dataset names.
If a data file is already open and does not have a dataset name, opening
new data files will cause it to close.</p>
<p class="bullet">• 
If a syntax or output file is open and has been modified but not
resaved, it will not be reopened by this command.</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Password for Opening Files</span> 
You can specify a single password to be used for the files in the
OPEN section of the project as either encrypted or in plain text.  Project files themselves
are not encrypted.
</p>

<p><span class="runinhead">Statistics Startup</span>
Choose whether future sessions should automatically open this
project when Statistics starts, should stop opening this project,
or should continue with current behavior.  Choosing the second
or third buttons will overwrite or remove a startup script if
one already exists and the script appears to have been created
by this command. </p>
<p class="bullet">• 
On some systems, Statistics may not have sufficient permissions to
create or remove the script.  Starting Statistics using Run As Administrator
may solve this problem on Windows 7 and similar.</p>

<h2>More on Opening a Project Automatically When Statistics Starts</h2>
See Help > Core System > Scripting Facility > Startup Scripts for full details
on startup scripts.  If you want to combine automatic project opening with
a larger startup script, you can add code like this to that script.
</p>
<p><span class="code">
import SpssClient<br/>
SpssClient.StartClient()<br/>
SpssClient.RunSyntax(r"""STATS OPEN PROJECT FILE="project filename".""")<br/>
SpssClient.StopClient()<br/>
</span>
<p>The startup script is named StartClient_.py and must be in the scripts subdirectory of the
SPSS Statistics installation.</p>
<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<p>
This dialog generates syntax for the STATS OPEN PROJECT extension command. To display syntax help for this command,
run the following syntax:
</p>
<p class="codeblock">STATS OPEN PROJECT /HELP.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
This command requires the Python Essentials
You can download the Essentials via the SPSS Community website at www.ibm.com/developerworks/spssdevcentral
or from your installation materials.  With Statistics 22 or later, the Essentials are
included by default in your Statistics installation.
